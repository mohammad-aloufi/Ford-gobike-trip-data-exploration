# Fordgobike tripdata exploration
## by Mohammad Aloufi


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system , covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset is about the trips that were made in February of 2019.


## Summary of Findings

1. I discovered that overall people use the service for work and trips go down on weekends. Now that might be a bit subjective but I think the fact that when on work days the trips are much more in demand between 6 Am and 6 Pm, so that's  another proof.
2. Males take more trips than females, They even take longer trips than females in average. However, on a daily basses, females take longer trips than males, not by much though.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I first showed gender usage and how males use the service more than females. After then I showed the user type usage (subscribers or customers) and how subscribers use it more than actual customers.
Last thing I showed the relationship between the week day, user type and the trip duration and how customers take longer trips than subscribers.
